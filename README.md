# Pxls Constructor

A bot for Pxls.space.

Before you use this purely expiremental tool, please keep in mind that **bots are not allowed on Pxls.space** and you will be banned if discovered, with all your pixels reverted. However, if there is a site that uses the Pxls codebase but doesn't have the restriction on bots, you can use it there instead.

## Usage

This tool depends on two methods from the API being exposed: `App.place` and `App.color`. This will require some manual changes to the code (`pxls.js`), but as soon as you get this part working, it is as simple as pasting the contents of `constructor.js` into the developer console.
